You must first login to minecaft.net and get your cookies. Put this in the tool and it will begin to get the list of MC Classic servers. It will also get the info for them. It will then connect to them all (It will also print their chats) and save their connection data to the hard drive. Once it has connected to all of the servers it will wait 30 secs and then exit. Ready for stage Two.\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Decode\r\nThis is load up all the data produced in step 1. Then run though the files and extracting their levels.\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Cartography\r\nThis will now look at all the level files extracted in step 2 and turn them into PNG images.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
